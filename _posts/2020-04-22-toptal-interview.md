# Being in rush to be hired by Toptal was a bad idea

The real meaning of this article is - do not apply for Toptal if you don't have **2 years of experince** in web development (in whatever field you are applying to).

But if you want to read my story and want to know why being in rush to be hired by Toptal was a bad idea then let's go!
Recently, I have seen a post in FB group named [Tashkent Developers ::jobs](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tasdev.jobs){:target="_blank"} about the job opportunity at [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/){:target="_blank"}. That was on 18th of April. I registered in Toptal by answering several questions related to remote work and my preferable technology stack. After fulfilling everything, I was assigned an interview with Communication Specialist in April 22 at 18:00. In the email that I have received about an interview, it was written: " ... prepare a concise overview of your professional skills and ambitions. You do not need to provide a large amount of detail, simply major recent projects that you would like to mention preliminarily. We will do more in depth in later interviews. ". And after that I haven't prepared much and simply waited for that day to come. When April 22 arrived, the chronology went like this: 
* 14:00 - I talked with the guy who shared that post about [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/){:target="_blank"} and asked what will be interview. He explained that they are just going to check my English (and interviewer didn't say anything about my English, that was fine I guess)
* 15:00 - I started to Google to see how others passed their Toptal interview. Finally I found really helpful article on [Medium](https://medium.com/@karolisram/getting-into-toptal-the-entire-process-f3ee4f931949). There author wrote that "first interview will be about the motivation behind applying, how many hours you are planning to work, hourly rate

As soon as she heard that I work as RA: she asked: professionaly speaking, how much experience you have in web development, not considering your research and other work
What she said: you need at least two years of experience. RA experience is not enough. You need experience of working with clients, doing projects...
15:00
18:30 I received an email: sorry


EPAM interview as well



Last year, I made a web app for HR.
#Toptal : You don't have required abilities.
At least 2 years of experience required.
